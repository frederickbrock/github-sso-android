Github Single Sign On
=====================

This is a small library to help you facilitate Github sign in within your app. Run the sample app to get a taste of what this looks like.

TODO:
  - Upload aar to maven for easy inclusion in other apps
  - Make a GithubSSO Fragment.
  - Backport to lower level API versions (but not really, because not worth it).
  - Make a PR to the Github Android app to take care of this if the user has the app installed.
